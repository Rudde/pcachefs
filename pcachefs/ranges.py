# A group of ranges.

# This class is a list with special awareness of Range objects. It will
# re-jig its contents as new Ranges are added to ensure that Ranges never
# overlap and are in order.
#
# For example:
#   ranges = Ranges()
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(0, 3))
#   # ranges now just contains (0, 3)
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(6, 10))
#   # ranges = (0,3) (6,10)
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(7, 15))
#   # ranges = (0,3) (6,15)
#	# (6,10) and (7,15) overlap so they have been merged and the 
#   # resulting range that is covered by both is added instead
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(3, 5))
#   # ranges = (0,5) (6,15)
#   # (0,3) and (3,5) overlap, so they are merged
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(5, 6))
#   # ranges = (0,15)
#   # (5,6) overlaps with both (0,5) and (6,15) so it is merged with both
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(15, 16))
#   # ranges = (0,16)
#
#   ranges.add_range(Range(1, 3))
